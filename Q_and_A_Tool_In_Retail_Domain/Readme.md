## Tools and Technologies
- **LangChain**: Framework for connecting language models to databases.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Language model for SQL generation and answer formulation.
- **HuggingFace Embeddings**: For semantic similarity-based example selection.
- **FAISS**: Vector search library for storing and retrieving few-shot examples.
- **MySQL**: Database for inventory and pricing data.
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for building the user interface.
- **dotenv**: Securely manages API keys and credentials.

## How It Works
1. User enters a natural language question (e.g., "How many Levi's shirts are in stock?").
2. The system retrieves the most relevant few-shot examples using FAISS and semantic similarity.
3. LangChain generates a SQL query tailored to the userâ€™s question.
4. The query is executed on the MySQL database to fetch results.
5. The result is processed into a natural language answer and displayed in the app.
